Given an array of n integers. Find the first element that occurs atleast k number of times. If no such element exists in the array, then expect the answer to be -1.

Example 1:

Input :
n = 7, k = 2
a[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
Output :
4
Explanation :
Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 4 is first that occurs twice.
As at index = 4, 4 has occurred twice whereas 7 appeared twice
at index 6.

SOLUTION:-
class Solution{
    public:
    int firstElementKTime(int n, int k, int a[])
    {
        unordered_map<int,int> mpp;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            mpp[a[i]]++;
           if(mpp[a[i]]==k){
               return a[i];
           }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
